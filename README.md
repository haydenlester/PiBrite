# PiBrite
A notification program for Raspberry Pi's to display notifications to a character-based LCD.

## How do I use it?
*It is not functional as of now*

Planned information to come later includes:
- a diagram for GPIO connections
- a standard format for notifications using XML
- information on configuring the server

Notifications will be sent in an XML format via TCP, these notifications will be read onto the LCD.

## Where is the client?
The beauty of it, is that you will make your own client to send any kind of notification you want to the LCD.

Potential uses:
- News articles
- Discord messages
- Emails
- Etc.

Clients may be developed at a later date, and packaged optionally with the software.
A module may also be packaged optionally to accept and convert RSS feeds.
